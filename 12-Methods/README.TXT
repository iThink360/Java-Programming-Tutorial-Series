Greetings, fellow Thinker! iThink360 here. Thanks for downloading my code!

The purpose of uploading this project is to serve as a reference for Episode
17 of my Java Programming Tutorial series, where we begin our investigation
of Java methods and parameters!

We will expand upon this project in Episode 18.

Classes:
    * Methods --> Contains some examples of declaring methods and parameters.
                  main() is also within this class.

Individual details can be found in the respective classes of my program. For
further confirmation, check out the video on my YouTube channel.

Feel free to access the code through BlueJ or through whatever other IDE
you choose. All example method calls are tested in main()! Long gone are the
days of creating multiple main methods.

As always, drop comments if you are confused or if you would like to reach out.

Together,
We are Thinkers...
We are one family...
We are unity...

But most importantly, your role in our community is simply being YOU.
