Greetings, fellow Thinker! iThink360 here. Thanks for downloading my code!

The purpose of uploading this project is to serve as a reference for Episodes
17 and 18 of my Java Programming Tutorial series. In Episode 17, we begin our
investigation of Java methods and parameters, and in Episode 18, we learn about
method return types and method overloading.

Classes:
    * Methods --> Contains some examples of declaring methods, parameters, and
                  method calls. We also have some examples of methods that
                  return data and overloaded methods. main() is also within
                  this class.

Individual details can be found in the Methods class of this project. For even
further confirmation, check out the video on my YouTube channel.

Feel free to access the code through BlueJ or through whatever other IDE
you choose. All example method calls are tested in main()!

As always, drop comments if you are confused or if you would like to reach out.
