Hi there! iThink360 here. Thanks for downloading my code!

The purpose of uploading this project is more or less to show a few examples of
variables and primitives in Java, and how they work. There is so much you can
do with variables alone... so much that I was not able to get through all of it,
although I hope that this sample snippet of code helps you get a grasp of a few
examples in some way, shape, or form.

There are a couple of examples involving operators; however, we will cover
operators in depth in the next video, as there are so many to learn about. As
a result, if you may be confused, don't worry, we'll clear that confusion up
real quick ;-)

All of the examples are inside of the main method in MyClass.java. Feel free
to access the code through BlueJ or through whatever other IDE you choose.
As always, drop comments if you are confused or if you would like to reach out.

Like and subscribe! I really do appreciate it. Stay safe, stay healthy, keep
Thinking360, and I'll catch you in the next one!
