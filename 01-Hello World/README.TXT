Hi there! iThink360 here. Thanks for downloading my code!

The purpose of uploading this project is to give an example of my "Hello World!"
program that we wrote in Episode 1 of my Java Programming Tutorial series. I
did not address any syntax at all in the corresponding video (Episode 1),
although I did leave some additional comments in the code that may prove useful
in terms of guiding your way through exploring MyClass.java.

I also used our "Hello World!" project in Episode 2, where we dove into the
depths of core syntax used in Java programming. There is quite a lot to cover,
though, so I won't be able to put much here.

Feel free to access MyClass.java through BlueJ or whatever other IDE you choose.
As always, drop comments if you are confused or if you would like to reach out.

Like and subscribe! I really do appreciate it. Stay safe, stay healthy, keep
Thinking360, and I'll catch you in the next one!
