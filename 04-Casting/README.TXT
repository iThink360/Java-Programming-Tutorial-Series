Hi there! iThink360 here. Thanks for downloading my code!

The purpose of uploading this project is to show a few examples of casting in
Java. This corresponds with Episode 5 of my Java Programming Tutorial series,
which you can find on my YouTube channel.

There are 2 types of casting in Java: widening casting (which happens automatically),
and narrowing casting (which happens manually). Widening casting is when you convert
a smaller primitive type into a larger type size, and narrowing casting happens the
other way around. Confused? Watch the video to find out more... ;-)

We only focused on primitive type casting in this video, since we have not learned
anything about Objects yet. As such, class casting will have to be saved for a future
episode.

I would like you guys to know that the file Errors.java intentionally contains some
code errors. The purpose behind that is to demonstrate some casting errors that
may occur, and the most appropriate way that I could think of arranging the code
was to write it in a separate class.

All of the examples are inside of the main method(s) in each of the classes. Feel free
to access the code through BlueJ or through whatever other IDE you choose.

NOTE: If you are running my code through another IDE that is not BlueJ, you will
probably need to reformat some method names as you cannot have more than 1 main
method in a Java project. BlueJ is flexible in the sense that you choose which
method to run when you right click on a class. However, in most Java IDE's, you
have to click a Run button, upon which the IDE automatically scouts for the
program's entry point... aka the main method. If there are multiple, the program
may crash, so be aware of that.

As always, drop comments if you are confused or if you would like to reach out.

Like and subscribe! I have also opened up an Instagram and a Twitter, so do
be sure to follow those pages to stay updated... I really do appreciate it.

Stay safe, stay healthy, keep Thinking360, and I'll catch you in the next one!
