Greetings, fellow Thinker! iThink360 here. Thanks for downloading my code!

The purpose of uploading this project is to serve as an answer key for the
Module 1 Challenge of my Java Programming Tutorial Series! This corresponds
with Episodes 15 and 16 of my tutorial series.

Episode 15 covers Phases 1-5 of the Challenge, while Episode 16 covers the
rest.

Episode 15 Classes:
    * PhaseOne --> Challenge on print statements.
    * PhaseTwo --> Challenge on variables, primitives, and arithmetic
                   operators.
    * PhaseThree --> Challenge on assignment operators.
    * PhaseFour --> Challenge on logical operators.
    * PhaseFive --> Challenge on relational operators, instanceof, and
                    boolean expressions.

Episode 16 Classes:
    * PhaseSix --> Challenge on primitive casting.
    * PhaseSeven --> Challenge on Strings.
    * PhaseEight --> Challenge on final constants, the Math class, and viewing
                     reading the API Documentation.
    * PhaseNine --> Challenge on conditional statements (if-else, switch)
    * PhaseTen --> Challenge on loops and arrays.

Individual details can be found in the respective classes of my program. For
further confirmation, check out the video on my YouTube channel.

All of the examples are inside of the main method(s) in each of the classes. Feel free
to access the code through BlueJ or through whatever other IDE you choose.

NOTE: If you are running my code through another IDE that is not BlueJ, you will
probably need to reformat some method names as you cannot have more than 1 main
method in a Java project. BlueJ is flexible in the sense that you choose which
method to run when you right click on a class. However, in most Java IDE's, you
have to click a Run button, upon which the IDE automatically scouts for the
program's entry point... aka the main method. If there are multiple, the program
may crash, so be aware of that.

As always, drop comments if you are confused or if you would like to reach out.
