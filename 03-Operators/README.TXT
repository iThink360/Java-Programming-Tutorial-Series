Hi there! iThink360 here. Thanks for downloading my code!

The purpose of uploading this project is for you to have, at your fingertips,
a quick reference of the basics of Java operators. Although the class names have
been altered so they no longer include "Operators" in the names (lol), the rest
remains the exact same.

For details, you will need to watch the video. However, you can get a pretty
good idea of what is going on in the code.

I would also like everyone to know that I did not cover bitwise operators in
this tutorial, since they are super advanced, and I did not know that they even
exist, let alone how to use them.

All of the examples are inside of the main method(s) in each of the classes. Feel free
to access the code through BlueJ or through whatever other IDE you choose.

NOTE: If you are running my code through another IDE that is not BlueJ, you will
probably need to reformat some method names as you cannot have more than 1 main
method in a Java project. BlueJ is flexible in the sense that you choose which
method to run when you right click on a class. However, in most Java IDE's, you
have to click a Run button, upon which the IDE automatically scouts for the
program's entry point... aka the main method. If there are multiple, the program
may crash, so be aware of that.

As always, drop comments if you are confused or if you would like to reach out.

Like and subscribe! I have also opened up an Instagram and a Twitter, so do
check the video description for more information... I really do appreciate it.

Stay safe, stay healthy, keep Thinking360, and I'll catch you in the next one!
