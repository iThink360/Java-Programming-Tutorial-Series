Greetings, fellow Thinker! iThink360 here. Thanks for downloading my code!

The purpose of uploading this project is to serve as a quick reference for our
Java String journey. This corresponds with Episodes 6 , 7, and 8 of my Java
Programming Tutorial series, which you can find on my YouTube channel.

Strings may seem like simple pieces of text; however, there is more than what meets
the eye. Strings are Java objects, and they behave differently compared to primitives
(such as ints, booleans, doubles, and so on).

A few differences between Java primitives and Java Objects (including Strings) are:
    - Primitives reserve a fixed amount of memory space, while Objects vary dynamically
      depending on the data referenced.
    - Primitive variables act as slots to hold their own piece of data, while Objects
      are more typically associated with the terms "instance" and "reference." An object
      is an instance of a class (an Object is constructed from a class, which acts like a
      blueprint), and a reference is the name that points to the actual Object itself.
      When writing code, we refer to Objects by reference names (similar to variable names)
      unless an Object is anonymous (has no reference). A String Object can also be seen as
      an instance of the String class, and should we store a String in a String variable,
      the name of the variable is known as the reference.
    - Numbers in Strings CANNOT be used for numeric calculations. That is for primitive
      integers.

All of the examples are inside of the main method(s) in each of the classes. Feel free
to access the code through BlueJ or through whatever other IDE you choose.

NOTE: If you are running my code through another IDE that is not BlueJ, you will
probably need to reformat some method names as you cannot have more than 1 main
method in a Java project. BlueJ is flexible in the sense that you choose which
method to run when you right click on a class. However, in most Java IDE's, you
have to click a Run button, upon which the IDE automatically scouts for the
program's entry point... aka the main method. If there are multiple, the program
may crash, so be aware of that.

P.S... I will be using the same project for Episode 8, since we will continue
to learn about Strings in those episodes as well. Therefore, depending on when
you download this project, you may end up having an older copy. Do check back
on the channel to retrieve the latest code!

P.S.S... The footage acted wonky for null references, although there is still
a class in the project if you wish to take a look.

As always, drop comments if you are confused or if you would like to reach out.
