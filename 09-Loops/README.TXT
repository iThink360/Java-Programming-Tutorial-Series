Greetings, fellow Thinker! iThink360 here. Thanks for downloading my code!

The purpose of uploading this project is to serve as a quick reference for
Java loops, including the use of while, do-while, and for loops. Note that
the for-each loop was NOT covered today and will be handled next week.

Classes:
    * While --> Practice of while loops.
    * DoWhile --> Pracice of do-while loops.
    * For --> Practice of for loops.

Break Keyword: To break from a loop, use the break keyword followed by a
semicolon. When this line of code is reached, the loop will immediately exit.

Continue Keyword: To skip the current iteration of a loop and move directly
to the next iteration, use the continue keyword followed by a semicolon.

Individual details can be found in the respective classes of my program. For
further confirmation, check out the video on my YouTube channel.

All of the examples are inside of the main method(s) in each of the classes. Feel free
to access the code through BlueJ or through whatever other IDE you choose.

NOTE: If you are running my code through another IDE that is not BlueJ, you will
probably need to reformat some method names as you cannot have more than 1 main
method in a Java project. BlueJ is flexible in the sense that you choose which
method to run when you right click on a class. However, in most Java IDE's, you
have to click a Run button, upon which the IDE automatically scouts for the
program's entry point... aka the main method. If there are multiple, the program
may crash, so be aware of that.

As always, drop comments if you are confused or if you would like to reach out.
